# Photon Moisture Watch

Project created for operation on Particle Photon development board. 
Compiled and flashed using Particle Workbench VSCode Extension. 
Created to monitor plant soil moisture using SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor. 
The moisture level of the soil is displayed on a 2x8 character I2C LCD display, as well as the time since the last water. 
To avoid corrosion in the soil moisture sensor, AD conversions are only completed once per 10 minutes, and the sensor receives no power otherwise. 
In future versions, alerts will be sent using IoT capabilities of Photon board to alert owner when the plant has gone too long without water.
